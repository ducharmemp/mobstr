## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Disabling of constraint checks via options argument to initializeStore
* Complex indexed values
    * Indexes can now be built against any object, not just primitives
    * Indexes are built deterministically using object-hash, so there's no need
    * Values can now be queried using index values or other properties using the findXBy functions. If a value hasn't been indexed then it falls back to a normal, slow filter and warns.
* findAllBy and findOneBy
    * Supports queries for non-primary key properties
    * findOneBy throws an exception if no values are found or if many values are found
