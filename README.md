# MobStr

MobStr is a project designed to provide an ORM-like interface to a MobX store. The goal of this project is to achieve a low-overhead, normalized approach to modeling to allow developers to focus on domain modeling without having to deal with manual book-keeping of object relationships.

While developing projects, I found myself maintaining more book-keeping maps and objects than I enjoyed, and had to remember to invalidate certain relationships with objects to avoid having dangling references to objects within the maps. I also disliked the overall method that I had to use to find the related objects. Too often I find myself accidentally slipping in attributes that are meant to achieve faster performance for lookup to my store objects, such as maps or objects. This works for a time, but then my model becomes polluted with extra attributes that I need to keep in sync and the model deviates further from my actual intention. Additionally, it's actually fairly easy to make certain guarantees that MobX provides invalid by complete accident, especially when copying string keys from observable objects into another observable. The answer is to leverage `computed` or `autorun` or other reaction-based functions, but this library *should* abstract over those to the point where the user doesn't need to necessarily worry about committing error-prone code.

With this project, I hope to separate the concerns of managing a centralized store with an accessible syntax for describing model relationships and model structure. Eventually I also hope to integrate nice-to-have features, such as index only lookups, complex primary key structures, and relationship cascades.

## Technical Details
<details>
  <summary><b>Why not mobx-state-tree or other existing libraries instead of developing this solution?</b></summary>
I wanted to tinker a bit with how far I could take this project while punting on features such as state snapshots and state rewinding. I haven't been in a debugging situation where it was helpful for me personally, so MobX-state-tree and others have a bit too much complexity for my taste.
  
All told, this project is about 200 lines of actual code (so far!), with most of the actual code lying in the decorators to set up meta attributes and maintain book-keeping, so it should achieve a very similar result to mobx-state-tree while cutting down on the complexity. LOC isn't a great metric for complexity or scope but it's what I have on hand.

<details>
  <summary><b>What is this `__meta__` attribute attatched to my objects?</b></summary>
MobStr needs to maintain records of primary keys names, collection names, and related objects *somewhere*, so shoving them into the added objects was a short-term solution to get up and running. Eventually I hope to separate these meta attributes from the actual models and store that information in the central store in order to avoid any confusion in console.log outputs or object inspection.

As of now, the form that the `__meta__` attribute takes is this:
```js
__meta__: {
    key: IObservableValue<string | symbol | number | null>;

    collectionName: string | symbol | number;
    relationships: Record<
      string | symbol,
      {
        type: any;
        keys: IObservableArray<string>;
        options: Record<string, any>;
      }
    >;
    indicies: IObservableArray<string | symbol | number>;
  };
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Why decorators?</b></summary>
I previously developed back-end applications in python, so you could say that Flask/SQLAlchemy inspired the initial implementation. Relationship definitions were also inspired by the fantastic TypeORM library. I find that decorators provide a nice semantic over the meaning of the invocation, while staying relatively out of the way for type definitions. This means that in TypeScript, we can "properly" type our model attrbutes to match the mental model of the developer. This does come with some footguns that are unfortunate, which I will call out specifically at a later date.

<details>
  <summary><b>Does this have anything to do with network calls?</b></summary>
At this time, no. There are plenty of ORMs for REST interfaces and GrahQL interfaces that are more feature complete than a hobby project, and I wanted to focus on an area that I felt was lacking in the front-end.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Can I store arbitrary objects without a prototype in the store without defining a model?</b></summary>
Not exactly, at least not yet. I hope to make that a 1.0 feature. However, the likelihood of allowing similar definitions of `relationship` and `primaryKey` is uncertain at this time, due to the need for type names for storage purposes. It's entirely possible that this library could also offer a `collection` wrapper that would allow similar semantics for plain old objects.
